# audio-net

An attempt at audio transformations via neural networks

# 18th Feb, 2024

This project aims to implement the [guitar amplifier emluation paper][1].

While the original implementation is in C++, I am planning on doing it in Python just to get a hang of how things work.

# To Dos

- [ ] Get a [dataset][2]

- [ ] Build the model
